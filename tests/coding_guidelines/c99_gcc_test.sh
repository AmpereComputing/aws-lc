# - This compilation line gets no source files as its input (it uses the -c flag).
#   Instead it uses the force include flag (-include) to include all of headers
#   except for arm_arch.h, which cannot run on x86-64 architectures.
# - The -Wpedantic flag ensures that the compiler will fault if a non C99 line 
#   exists in the code.
# - The -fsyntax-only tells the compiler to check the syntax without producing 
#   any outputs.
