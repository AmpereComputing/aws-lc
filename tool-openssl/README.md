# OpenSSL Tools for AWS-LC
*Files expected to change*

Current status: 
* Developed structure for new OpenSSL tools 
* Contains initial implementation for OpenSSL x509 tool, options -in and -out (x509.cc), and unit test (x509_test.cc)
* x509_test.cc contains test portions ultimately to be used for future options but unnecessary for -in/-out unit test
