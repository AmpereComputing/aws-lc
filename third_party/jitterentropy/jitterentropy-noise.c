/**
 * Memory Access noise source -- this is a noise source based on variations in

 *
 * This function performs memory accesses which will add to the timing
 * variations due to an unknown amount of CPU wait states that need to be
 * added when accessing memory. The memory size should be larger than the L1
 * caches as outlined in the documentation and the associated testing.
 *
 * The L1 cache has a very high bandwidth, albeit its access rate is  usually
 * slower than accessing CPU registers. Therefore, L1 accesses only add minimal
 * variations as the CPU has hardly to wait. Starting with L2, significant
 * variations are added because L2 typically does not belong to the CPU any more
 * and therefore a wider range of CPU wait states is necessary for accesses.
 * L3 and real memory accesses have even a wider range of wait states. However,
 * to reliably access either L3 or memory, the ec->mem memory must be quite
 * large which is usually not desirable.
 *
 * @ec [in] Reference to the entropy collector with the memory access data -- if
 *	    the reference to the memory block to be accessed is NULL, this noise
 *	    source is disabled
 * @loop_cnt [in] if a value not equal to 0 is set, use the given value as
 *		  number of loops to perform the hash operation
