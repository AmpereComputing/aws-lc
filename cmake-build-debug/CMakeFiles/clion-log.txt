CMake Error at crypto/CMakeLists.txt:65 (enable_language):
  No CMAKE_ASM_NASM_COMPILER could be found.

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "ASM_NASM" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_ASM_NASM_COMPILER to the
  full path to the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
